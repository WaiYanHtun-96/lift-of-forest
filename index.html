                                            Pandas live mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China,
                                            where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They play a crucial role in the
                                            bamboo forests by spreading seeds and facilitating growth of vegetation.
                                            Panda‚Äôs suffer from habitat loss due to the construction of roads and railroads,

                                                Saolas are one of the rarest and most threatened mammals on the planet. They are a 
                                                cousin of cattle but resemble antelope. They are critically endangered and are found
                                                only in the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. As forests disappear under the

                                            largest tree-climbing mammal. They make nests of trees of vegetation to sleep in at night and

                                            in their habitats. Their habitat is fast disappearing to make way for oil palm plantations and 
                                            other agricultural plantations. Today, more than 50% of orangutans are found outside protected
                                            areas in forests under management by timber, palm oil, and mining companies. Orangutans live
                                            on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. The island of Sumatra has lost 85% of its forests and

                                            African forest elephants inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa. They are smaller 
                                            than African savanna elephants, with more oval-shaped ears and straighter tusks that point downward.
                                            By eating more fruits from more tree species than probably any other large vertebrate, forest elephants 
                                            are essential for the dispersal and germination of many rain forest trees. For some of these species, 
                                            their seeds will only germinate after passing through the elephant‚Äôs digestive tract. In short,
                                            elephants are true forest gardeners. Their range has been shrinking rapidly from 3 million square miles
                                            in 1979 to less than 1 million square miles today. Poaching has further decimated their remaining 
                                            populations by over 65% from 2002 to 2013. These elephants are being pushed into smaller islands of 
                                            protected areas, further hindering their freedom to roam and long term survival.
